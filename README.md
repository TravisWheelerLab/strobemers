# Fast alignment-free similarity estimation methods in Rust.

## Overview
This repository contains two programs:
1. A program for generating DNA sequences with pre-computed alignment scores (`cargo run --bin generate_string_pairs`)
2. A program for estimating string pairs' similarity and outputting that data to a CSV file. (`cargo run --bin generate_comparison_data`).

## Progress and Development
This project is still very much in development. 
TODO: Makefile for fast and intuitive usage. 
TODO: Figure out what to do next...
